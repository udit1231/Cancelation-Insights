   They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
- As the ration of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
- In the month of January hotels can start canpaigns and marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
- They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
